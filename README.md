# Intensity-Analysis

### Intensity Analysis using NLP and Python

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to develop an intelligent system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to predict the intensity in text reviews. By analyzing various parameters and processing data, the system aims to predict intensity categories such as happiness, angriness, or sadness. This predictive capability will enable proactive process optimization and contribute to overall customer satisfaction.

## Models Used

The following machine learning models were employed in the project:

1. Naive Bayes
2. Random Forest
3. Logistic Regression

## Model Performance

The accuracy achieved based on each model during evaluation is as follows:

- Naive Bayes: 77%
- Random Forest: 61%
- Logistic Regression: 77%
